Objective:
The objective of this part of the Fnal assignment is to create dashboards to contain your plots and charts and to provide the directors with the ability to select a particular report or a period of time so they can discuss the data in detail.

In this lab you will create dashboards using Dash and Plotly and then add user-interactions to your dashboards.

Creating dashboards and adding customizations to the dashboards
The directors of XYZAutomobiles have requested a dashboard to be developed so they can drill into the data in more detail for specific years or by different categories. Your second task is to create a suitable dashboard and add in user interactions so that the directors can select the data they want to review without the need to request new plots.
